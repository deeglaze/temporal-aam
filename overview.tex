Temporal contracts provide a declarative language for monitoring the temporal ordering of events that pass through module boundaries.
%
We analyze a slightly different presentation than ~\citeauthor{ianjohnson:dfm:icfp2011}'s temporal contracts that allows more precise specification of value use.
%
The syntax is presented in \autoref{fig:tcontract-syntax}.
%%

%%
Temporal contracts ($\mtcon$) include events ($\mevent$) (for $\mevent$ction), negated events ($\snonevent{\mevent}$), concatenation ($\stseq{\mtcon}{\mtcon}$) (often represented using juxtaposition), negated contracts ($\stnot{\mtcon}$), Kleene closure of events ($\stmany{\mtcon}$), union ($\stOr{\mtcon}{\mtcon}$), intersection ($\stAnd{\mtcon}{\mtcon}$), the universal temporal contract ($\sddd$), the empty temporal contract ($\stfail$), and higher-order binding events ($\stcall{\mname}{\mvar}$ and $\stret{\mname}{\mvar}$).
%
The difference between $\snonevent{\mevent}$ and $\stnot{\mtcon}$ is that the first must be an event and force time to step forward once, whereas the second may match arbitrarily many events.
%%

%%
Events themselves are expressed as patterns denoting calls ($\scallev{\mname}{\mvpat}$) or returns ($\sretev{\mname}{\mvpat}$), with respect to a particular function $\mname$ and with its argument or result matching a pattern $\mvpat$.
%
If $\mname$ is a label ($\mtoplevelname$), we simply check that the monitor wrapping the function has the same label (attached via the structural contract).
%
However, if $\mname$ is a variable ($\mvar$), then we consult a binding environment that the monitoring system builds as we pass binding events to determine if the function is exactly equal to the value bound.
%
Our distinction between variables (bound by temporal contract) and labels (bound by structural contract) is one aspect of what separates our semantics from \citeauthor{ianjohnson:dfm:icfp2011}'s.
%
Patterns can match constants ($\mconstant$), bound variables ($\mvar$), labeled functions ($\mtoplevelname$), or simply anything ($\swc$).
%%

%%
\citeauthor{ianjohnson:dfm:icfp2011}'s semantics for referring to functions is problematic; we give a slightly different account that captures the spirit of their prose describing their system, and indeed mirrors their actual implementation.
%
Consider one of their motivating examples (recalled---using our syntax and semantics---and discussed in \autoref{sec:sort}), which was to protect the comparator passed to a sort function from escaping the scope of the call.
%
What this should mean is the particular binding introduced by a call to $sort$ cannot be called after $sort$ returns, \ie, each constructed monitor around given comparators should not be called after $sort$ returns.
%
However, the flat use of \emph{labels} instead of \emph{bindings} would cause a second call to a supposedly-correct $sort$ to fail, since it internally calls the comparator of the same label, but of a different monitor construction.
%
\citeauthor{ianjohnson:dfm:icfp2011}'s implementation also includes call/return matching via a different binding at the call site to eventually use in the matching return.
%
We leave call/return matching to future work, as it is not necessary to verify the motivating examples.

  &&\ret{sort} \sddd~ \call{cmp}~ \sddd)}
 \end{array}
 %\caption{Sort example}
 %\label{fig:sort}
\end{align*}

%%
This example gives contract for a hypothetical $sort$ function which takes two arguments: a comparator and a list (of positive numbers).
%
The notation ``$\mathit{name}\ :\ Domain\ \to\ Range$'' describes a function contract where the argument satisfies the $Domain$ contract and the result satisfies the $Range$ contract.
%
The ``$\mathit{name}\ :$'' prefix denotes the name of the function, for use in the temporal aspect of the contract.
%%

%%
$SortContract$ is also has a temporal component, given by the ``where'' clauses following its structural (function) contract.
%
The first of these clauses states that a second call to $sort$ may not occur (hence the negation of the trace) if there is no intervening return from $sort$ ($\stmany{\snonevent{\ret{sort}}}$).
%
This is specifying a particular safety property (as evidenced by the negation of the trace): $sort$ is supposed to be \emph{non-reentrant}.
%
The second temporal clause specifies a higher-order property; it states that, given a call to $sort$, its associated $cmp$ argument cannot be called after $sort$ returns.
%%

%%
Note also that the negated clauses of the temporal contract are prefixed and suffixed by ``$\sddd$''.
%TODO: Provide decent and intuitive explanation that doesn't require any forward-reference

 &FileContract =~ Record \\
 &\begin{array}{ @{\quad~}l@{\ :} @{~}l@{\ \to\ } l }
  read & Unit & String \\
  write & String & Unit \\
  close & Unit & Unit
 \end{array} \\
 &\text{where}\quad \sddd~ \ret{close}
 %\caption{File example}
 %\label{fig:file}
\end{align*}

%%
This example gives the contract for a hypothetical file system, which can be used to open files by giving the $open$ function a filename (a $String$); the client is then given a file handle contracted by $FileContract$.
%
A file handle, in turn, is a record of functions which interact with the file: $read$, $write$, and $close$, all which perform the expected behaviors.
%%

%%
The temporal contract is interesting: it is not phrased in terms of a negation, but rather an affirmation.
%
Its goal is to state that a user of the file is forbidden from making use of the file handle (through the use of its component functions) after the user has $close$d the file.
%
It is phrased such that there is no ``$\sddd$'' at the end of its trace; thus this means that the last reference one can make to such a monitored record is returning from $close$; after that, it cannot be used.
%
%TODO: Do we need to define prefix-closure?
Note that this is not a \emph{liveness property}; this does not mean that a return from $close$ \emph{must} happen, as traces are \emph{prefix-closed}.
%
Instead, the property is a \emph{safety property}, though expressed in the affirmative.

 \label{fig:tcp-fsm}
\end{figure}

%%
In \autoref{fig:tcp} we show the contract for a hypothetical TCP connection module.
%
A client of this module may $open$ a $\tcpsock$ for initiating a connection or may $listen$ to a $\tcpsock$ for passively connecting.
%
A $\tcpc$ is defined similarly to our file system example: it is a record of functions which interact with the connection: $send$, $recv$, $timeout$, and $close$.
%
Notably, $send$ and $recv$ interact with data in the form of $\tcpdata$, which can be one of the special packets used in the TCP protocol or can simply be some amount of user data ($\tcpstyle{Data}(\_)$).
%
%TODO: maybe express timing out in a better manner?
The $timeout$ function is simply internally used by the module to set timeouts for interactions with the other end of the TCP connection; clients do not directly use it and it is included solely for the ability to reason over timeouts in the temporal contract.
%%

%%
A socket on the ``sending'' end of the TCP connection (having used $open$) is obligated to use the connection according to the temporal component of $\tcpsendc$.
%
Likewise, a socket on the ``receiving'' end of the TCP connection (having used $listen$) is constrained by $\tcprecvc$.
%
The contracts are very involved, but they implement a simplified version of the TCP connection lifecycle given in \autoref{fig:tcp-fsm}.
%
Note that the temporal clause in each contract is phrased in the affirmative, as in \autoref{sec:file}; however, unlike that example, this property is indeed a (restricted) kind of \emph{liveness property}.
%
It states that the client uses the socket in a manner consistent with the TCP protocol and can expect the other end to as well.
%
The key difference between this property and a traditional liveness property is that it speaks of a liveness property with respect to \emph{a particular contract-monitoring} of a $\tcpc$; prefix-closure is still present at the top level (cf. \autoref{fig:tcontract-denotation}) and thus the protocol noted in the temporal contract may not occur if no $\tcpc$ is used.
