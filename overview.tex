Temporal contracts provide a declarative language for monitoring the temporal ordering of actions that pass through module boundaries.
%
We begin with a simple example that exhibits the expressiveness of temporal higher-order contracts to frame the discussion.
%
The following example comes from the original work on temporal higher-order contracts, and its behavior led us to explore alternative semantics.
%
\newcommand{\sortid}{\mathit{sort}}
\subsection{\dfm's sort example} \label{sec:sort}
%
This example presents the contract for a hypothetical $\sortid$ function which takes two arguments: a comparator and a list (of positive numbers), is non-reentrant, and furthermore cannot make its given comparator available to be called after it's done sorting.
%
We express the function component of the contract (with labels given to function components) like so:
\begin{align*}
  \sortid : (\mathit{cmp} : \mathit{Pos} \to \mathit{Pos} \to \mathit{Bool})\ (List\ Pos) \to (List\ Pos)
\end{align*}

We can express the temporal component of the contract in a natural way with the following:
\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\newcommand*{\call}[1]{\scallev{#1}{\_}}
\newcommand*{\ret}[1]{\sretev{#1}{\_}}
\begin{align*}
 \stnot{(\sddd \sortid(\_,\_)~ \stmany{\snonevent{\retof{\sortid}(\_)}}~ \sddd~ \sortid(\_,\_))}
 \cap \stnot{(\sddd~ \sortid(?\mathit{cmp}, \_)~ \sddd~ \retof{\sortid}(\_)~ \sddd~ \snonevent{\mathit{cmp}(\_,\_)})}
\end{align*}
%
%%
These contracts are attached to a sort implementation with a special expression form, {\tt tmon}, that additionally requires labels for who are the contracted parties.
%
The second clause of the temporal component specifies a higher-order property; given a call to $\sortid$, its associated $\mathit{cmp}$ argument cannot be called after $\sortid$ returns.
%
Since $\mathit{cmp}$ will be wrapped with its higher-order contract at each call, which creates new values, the bindings for $\mathit{cmp}$ will be distinct across execution.
%
The intention of the regular-expression notation is to say, ``as long as the trace is a prefix of these strings of actions, the temporal contract is satisfied.''
%
For example, $A$ satisfies the contract $ABC$, but $ABD$ doesn't.

  \caption{Syntax of structural contracts with labels}
  \label{fig:scontract-syntax}
\end{figure}

The general forms for expressing structural contracts and monitoring values are in \autoref{fig:scontract-syntax}.
%
The other forms of the language are irrelevant, but we of course assume the existence of $\lambda$ expressions.
%
Labels are used to express the identities of parties engaged in a software contract.
%
We have three parties: the provider of a value ($k$, the server, or positive party), the consumer of a value ($l$, the client, or negative party), and the provider of the contract ($j$, the contract, or self party).
%
Timelines, $\mtimeline$, are associated with unique runtime monitors, and are generated by evaluating {\tt tmon} expressions.
%%

%%
A structural monitor $\sSMon{k}{l}{j}{\mtimeline}{\mscon}{\mexp}$ is a behavioral monitor \citep{ianjohnson:dthf:complete}: the structural contract is given by $\mscon$, where actions of contracted values will be sent to the runtime monitor associated with the given timeline $\mtimeline$.
%
A temporal monitor $\sTMon{k}{l}{j}{\mscon}{\mtcon}{\mexp}$ produces a timeline $\mtimeline$, contracts $\mexp$ with $\mscon$ with respect to the timeline, and associates $\mtcon$ with $\mtimeline$.

\begin{figure}

  \motcon \in \TContract^\circ &::=
      \mevent \alt \snonevent{\mevent}

\mname \in \Name &::= \mvar \alt \mtoplevelname
  \end{align*}
  \caption{Syntax of temporal contracts}
  \label{fig:tcontract-syntax}
\end{figure}

%
The syntax is presented in \autoref{fig:tcontract-syntax}.
%
%
We notate sets of some element type with metavariable $e$ as $\isset{e}$, and lists as $\many{e}$.
%
We write the interpolation of sets and lists into many arguments as $e\ldots$, following the rules of \citet{dvanhorn:Kohlbecker1987Macrobyexample}.
%
The if-then-else syntax we use follows Dijkstra ($\mathit{guard} \to \mathit{then}, \mathit{else}$), where anything non-$\bot$ is considered true.
%
We use $x\equiv S(y,\ldots)$ to mean ``$x$ matches $S(y,\ldots)$;'' alternatively, there exist elements $y\ldots$ such that $x = S(y,\ldots)$.
%
For brevity, we will use $\mname(\mvpat)$ and $\retof{\mname}(\mvpat)$ to mean $\scallev{\mname}{\mvpat}$ and $\sretev{\mname}{\mvpat}$ respectively.
%%

%%
Structural contracts include subsets of first-order data that satisfy a particular predicate ($\sflat{\mexp}$), functions with associated structural contracts on their domain and range in addition to a label to reference within the temporal contract ($\sarr{\mtoplevelname}{\mscon_D}{\mscon_R}$), and {\tt cons} pairs whose components are contracted ($\sconsc{\mscon_A}{\mscon_D}$).
%%
Temporal contracts include actions ($\mevent$), negated actions ($\snonevent{\mevent}$), action matching scoped over a following contract ($\stbind{\mevent}{\mtcon}$), concatenation ($\stseq{\mtcon}{\mtcon}$) (often written using juxtaposition), negated contracts ($\stnot{\mtcon}$), Kleene closure of events ($\stmany{\mtcon}$), union ($\stOr{\isset{\mtcon}}$), intersection ($\stAnd{\isset{\mtcon}}$), the empty temporal contract ($\epsilon$), and an open temporal contract closed by an environment ($\motcon, \menv$).
%
We consider the fail contract $\bot$ as a macro for $\stOr{\setof{}}$, and \dfm's universal contract $\sddd$ a macro for $\stAnd{\setof{}}$.
%
The difference between $\snonevent{\mevent}$ and $\stnot{\mtcon}$ is that the first must be an action and force time to step forward once, whereas the second may match arbitrarily many actions.
%%

%%
Actions themselves are expressed as patterns denoting calls ($\scallev{\mname}{\mvpat}$) or returns ($\sretev{\mname}{\mvpat}$), with respect to a particular function named $\mname$ and with its argument or result matching a pattern $\mvpat$.
%
If $\mname$ is a label ($\mtoplevelname$), we simply check that the monitor wrapping the function has the same label.
%
Arrow contract monitors impose their label on the contracted function.
%
However, if $\mname$ is a variable ($\mvar$), then we consult a binding environment that the monitoring system builds as we pass binding actions to determine if the function is exactly equal to the value bound.
%
Patterns can match values ($\mval$), variable bindings and references ($\sbind{\mvar}$, $\mvar$), labeled functions ($\mtoplevelname$), structured data ($\scons(\mvpat,\mvpat)$), negated patterns that do not bind ($\snegpat{\mvpat}$), anything or nothing ($\sany$, $\snone$).

\end{align*}
%
%%
This example gives the contract for a hypothetical file system, which can be used to open files by giving the $open$ function a filename (a $String$); the client is then given a file handle contracted by $FileContract$.
%
A file handle, in turn, is a record of functions which interact with the file: $read$, $write$, and $close$, all which perform the expected behaviors.
%%
%
%%
The temporal contract is what is interesting: it is not phrased in terms of a negation, but rather an affirmation.
%
Its goal is to state that a user of the file is forbidden from making use of the file handle (through the use of its component functions) after the user has $close$d the file.
%
It is phrased such that there is no ``$\sddd$'' at the end of its trace; this means that the last reference one can make to such a monitored record is returning from $close$; after that, it cannot be used.
%
%TODO: Do we need to define prefix-closure?
Note that this is not a \emph{liveness property}; this does not mean that a return from $close$ \emph{must} happen, as traces are \emph{prefix-closed}.
%
Instead, the property is a \emph{safety property}, though expressed in the affirmative.

%
%%
In \autoref{fig:tcp} we show the contract for a hypothetical TCP connection module.
%
A client of this module may $open$ a $\tcpsock$ for initiating a connection or may $listen$ to a $\tcpsock$ for passively connecting.
%
A $\tcpc$ is defined similarly to our file system example; it is a record of functions which interact with the connection: $send$, $recv$, $timeout$, and $close$.
%
Notably, $send$ and $recv$ interact with data of the form $\tcpdata$, which can be one of the special packets used in the TCP protocol or can simply be some amount of user data ($\tcpstyle{Data}(\_)$).
%
%TODO: maybe express timing out in a better manner?
The $timeout$ function is unimportant to our discussion; it is used internally by the module to set timeouts for interactions with the other end of the TCP connection; clients do not directly use it and it is included solely for the ability to reason over timeouts in the temporal contract.
%%
%
%%
A socket on the ``sending'' end of the TCP connection (having used $open$) is obliged to use the connection according to the temporal component of $\tcpsendc$.
%
Likewise, a socket on the ``receiving'' end of the TCP connection (having used $listen$) is constrained by $\tcprecvc$.
%
The contracts are very involved, but they implement a simplified version of the TCP connection lifecycle given in \autoref{fig:tcp-fsm}.
%
Note that the temporal clause in each contract is phrased in the affirmative, as in \autoref{sec:file}; however, unlike that example, this property is indeed a (restricted) kind of \emph{liveness property}.
%
It states that the client uses the socket in a manner consistent with the TCP protocol and can expect the other end to likewise adhere.
%
The key difference between this property and a traditional liveness property is that it speaks of a liveness property with respect to \emph{a particular contract-monitoring} of a $\tcpc$; prefix-closure is still present at the top level (cf. \autoref{fig:tcontract-denotation}) and thus the protocol noted in the temporal contract may not occur if no $\tcpc$ is used.
