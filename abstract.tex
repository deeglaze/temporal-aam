Behavioral contracts are a runtime monitoring mechanism that give full access to the language to specify pre- and post-conditions, allowing expression of strong invariants that traditional type systems can not enforce.
%
%Contract violations during testing or even after deployment help fix both the implementation and specification of software without having to provide a proof of correctness up-front.

\emph{Temporal} higher-order contracts further provide a language for specifying and dynamically monitoring adherence to stateful protocols.
%
We contribute the first static verification of temporal higher-order contracts.
%
We do so by introducing a notion of derivative for regular expressions with back references.
%
A sound, straight-forward abstraction then produces a correct model-checker.
